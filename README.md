One of my first projects to learn React.

### Available Scripts

To run this project, you need:

```
Clone by using the source code url
`Yarn install` from the main directory
`Yarn start` - to run the app in the development mode.
`yarn build` - Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
```
